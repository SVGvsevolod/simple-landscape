# Simple Landscape HTML Webpage
This HTML webpage was a laboratory(practical) work for Computer Graphics discipline in university but it's quite universal can be used for various purposes like even a background (or not just background) for your homepage/new-tab-page in browser.

Script of this page generates randomm number of clouds and circles that forms those clouds visually, number of dandelions on ground and its flocks that comes out and when dandelion reaches out of flocks, only stem of dandelion remains. When page loads all stuff explained above generates and updates constantly and redraws the canvas. Still, while clouds go out of bounds to the right, new ones appear from the left, but for new dandelions and its flocks you have to refresh the page.

For convenience I integrated GitHub pages to [easily preview this webpage](https://svgvsevolod.github.io/simple-landscape/).
